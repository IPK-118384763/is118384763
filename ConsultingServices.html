       <h1>Blockchain</h1>
<p>I have a huge interest in the code and idea behind blockchain. I believe that blockchain is the future of the internet.</p> Blockchain is a series of code,that is not stored in one central location but multiple different locations.</p>
<p>How it works is by one party creating a block which is then validated by multiple computers across the net. 
 <p>This block is then connected to a chain, this chain is the reason that the block can be traced back to its very creation.</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to make a fake blockchain, because that would mean falsifying</p>
<p>thousands if not millions of blocks in the chain. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrency use</p>
<p>blockchain technology.</p>

        <h1>Autonomous Things</h1>
<p>In recent years there has been huge development in autonomous things such as robots, drones and</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles.In recent years businesses are thinking of switching their customer services</p>
<p>from people to robots. Surgical robots are also already entering the surgical rooms.. Autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>are already on the market with tesla's self-driving car.<a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_IE/autopilot?redirect=no">Tesla's website about their self-driving car.</a></p>
<p> Autonomous drones are also being used for mapping and agricultural work. They benefit from and use autonomous drones the most.</p> 
<p>Drones are perfect for surveying areas and recording data without the user having to do very much.</p>

        <h1> Immersive Experience </h1>
        <p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you so you feel that you are inside and part of that world.</p> 
        <p>Immersive Experience is associated with technological environments that create a sense of virtual realities and mixed realities.</p> 
        <p>There are two different versions of Immersive experience are AR and VR.<p>
        <p>AR which stands for Augmented Reality it is the blending of computer generated visuals over our real life environments.</p> 
        <p>VR stands for Virtual Reality it is the use of computers to create a new environments, unlike AR it completely replaces the users environment.</p> </p>
